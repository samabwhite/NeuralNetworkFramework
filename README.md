# Neural Network Framework

*The best way to learn is to make.* 

This is my implementation of a neural network framework, similar to a framework like tensorflow or pytorch. This framework allows you to piece together a neural network in a sandwich style.

It will throw errors based on whether it's a valid build. It gives you options for different types of layers, types of activation functions, etc.
